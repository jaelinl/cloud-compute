This is a repo about cloud compute
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet that allows you to access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases.
Types of Cloud Computing: 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): A virtual cloud base software that stores documents, records, digital assets and data on remote servers or computers, on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): This is a platform that includes tools and services for application development, testing, and deployment.
Software as a Service (SaaS): This delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install, manage, and maintain the software.
How Cloud Computing Benefits Businesses:
Cost-savings: Those with computing resources pay as they go, limiting up front costs and only pay for what they use and also eliminates the necessity of investing in hardware. 
Scalability: Businesses can scale their needs up or down without having to change their infrastructure. 
Accessibility, Reliability and Availability: Cloud has robust infrastructure which ensures high levels of reliability.
Availiability because it can be accessed even after a natural disaster. Cloud also ensures accessibility because it can be accessed from any location using any device that has Internet access.
